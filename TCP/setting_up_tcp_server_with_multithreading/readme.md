# TCP Server with Multi-threading
The key difference from simple TCP serve is that for each accepted client connection, a new thread (client_handler) is created to handle that specific client's communication. This allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

With this modification, each client that connects to the server will be processed in a separate thread, allowing for concurrent communication.
