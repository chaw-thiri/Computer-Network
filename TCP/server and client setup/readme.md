### Server Setup 

* Creates a socket using socket.socket() with socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_STREAM to create a TCP socket.
* Binds the socket to a specific host and port using server_socket.bind((host, port)).
* Listens for incoming connections using server_socket.listen(5).
* Accepts incoming connections in a loop with server_socket.accept().
* Starts a new thread (client_handler) for each accepted connection to handle clients concurrently.
### Client Setup 

* Creates a socket using socket.socket() with socket.AF_INET and socket.SOCK_STREAM to create a TCP socket.
* Defines a specific host and port for the server it wants to connect to.
* Attempts to connect to the server using client_socket.connect((host, port)).
* Sends a message to the server using client_socket.sendall(message.encode()).
* Receives and prints the server's response using client_socket.recv(1024).
### Here are some key differences between the server and client setups in this code:

* The server sets up the socket to listen and accept incoming connections (server_socket.accept()).
* The client sets up the socket to connect to a remote server (client_socket.connect((host, port))).
